A rainbow is an optical phenomenon where different frequencies of light are separated and appear as separate bands of colour.

The 7 bands of colour which are visible to the human eye are generally accepted as: -

Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Blue
Indigo
Violet

These colours are the "visible" part of the sun's radiation. But there are many other parts that are not visible to the human eye.
For example:
- immediately below red is "infraRED"
- immediately beyond violet is "ultraVIOLET" (UV)
